The goal of MAReco is to provide ecosystem indicator data, analysis, and plotting that contributes to ecosystem summary reports and stock assessment. Spatially, data in MAReco align with a variety of management areas. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of MAReco from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jamiectam/MAReco")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(MAReco)
## basic example code
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
